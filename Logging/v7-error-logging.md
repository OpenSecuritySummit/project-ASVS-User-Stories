#Application log requirements

## Narrative
As an application Owner
I want the applicaton to log events
So that incident detection and response can be triggered

### Scenario 1: Unexpected Input / security sensitive error 
#### 7.4.1

GIVEN an application receives unexpected input
WHEN an error occurs
THEN log event with a unique ID for support personnnel to investigate

### Scenario 2
#### 7.4.2
7.4.2 	Verify that exception handling (or a functional equivalent) is used across the codebase to account for expected and unexpected error conditions.

### Scenario 3
#### 7.4.3
7.4.3 	Verify that a "last resort" error handler is defined which will catch all unhandled exceptions.
