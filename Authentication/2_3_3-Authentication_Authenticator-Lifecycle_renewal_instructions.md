# ASVS Requirement: V2.3.3

## ASVS:.2.3.3

## ASVS Requirement description

Verify that renewal instructions are sent with sufficient time to renew time bound authenticators

## User Story

**Feature_Name**: send authenticator renewal instructions

**Story**:
As a Security Engineer\
I want to notify my users when their time bound authenticators are about to expire\
So that the user doesn't lose access to my services due to expired authenticators

NOTE: this requirement is somewhat *strange* as ASVS seems to refer to time-bound authenticators (so assuming it's related to token that have an expiry date on them, not the usual Authenticator apps which don't usually have a time-limit) but the NIST reference (6.1.4) says "The CSP SHOULD bind an updated authenticator an appropriate amount of time before an existing authenticatorâ€™s expiration.", which seems to suggest it relates to the time window between the token code changing and being useful/valid for the authentication process itself. I don't think they're the same. The assumption for the first scenario is that the token itself has a due-date and the second scenario has the assumption that we're managing the login process and validity of the challenge itself

## Scenario

**Scenario_name**: send authenticator renewal notification

**Gherkin syntax**:

```gherkin
Given a user login
And the user has token authentication enabled
When I request information from the user
Then I request a username and password pair
And I request the credentials from the authenticator app
Then I confirm that the credentials are valid
And I check if the authenticator will expire in the next X weeks
Then I notify the user that his credentials are about to expire and they should change it
```

**Scenario_name**: ensure authenticator credentials are valid

**Gherkin syntax**:

```gherkin
Given a user login
And the user has token authentication enabled
When I request information from the user
Then I request a username and password pair
And I request the credentials from the authenticator app
Then I verify that the authenticator code is used within X seconds of its timestamp
```
